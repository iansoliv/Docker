1. #### ubuntu-ros-melodic-python3

	A ROS melodic distro that is fully compatible with Python 3, both over Ubuntu 18.04.

	This image also exemplifies the configuration of a particular ROS-derived application named SimulationManager, what is a key resource for learning how to customize this image so that it may attend any other ROS-based application that employs Python 3. More specifically, this setup also exposes the details on how to configure a catkin workspace linked to the ROS melodic distro when employing Python 3, what is a mandatory procedure.
